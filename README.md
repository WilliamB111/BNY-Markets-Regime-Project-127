# Market Regime Modeling and Investment Strategies Project

## Project Description
This project, conducted within a university framework, aims to develop a robust market regime modeling model using financial data from the Bloomberg platform, focused on the United States region. The goal is to capture market trends and regime shifts, to subsequently develop and test adaptive investment strategies based on these identified regimes.

## Data Source
- **Platform**: Bloomberg
- **Geographic Region**: United States
- **Data Used**: Relevant financial data including asset prices, economic indicators, market data, among others.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Exploration of available data on Bloomberg for the United States region.
   - Cleaning and preprocessing of data to ensure their quality and reliability.
2. **Market Regime Modeling**:
   - Utilization of statistical methods and machine learning to model market regimes.
   - Application of models such as the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify different market regimes.
3. **Market Trend Analysis**:
   - Analysis of market trends to understand the dynamics and transitions between different regimes.
   - Evaluation of the impact of macroeconomic and microeconomic variables on market regimes.
4. **Investment Strategies Development**:
   - Development of adaptive investment strategies based on identified market regimes.
   - Backtesting of investment strategies on historical data to evaluate their performance.
5. **Evaluation and Improvement**:
   - Evaluation of the performance of regime models and investment strategies.
   - Iteration and improvement of models and strategies based on feedback and observed performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Data Management Tools**: SQL, Bloomberg API
